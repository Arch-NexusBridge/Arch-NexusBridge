### Project Name: **NexusBridge**

### Full Description:

#### Introduction:
In an era where web2's robust features and web3's secure decentralization were evolving independently, we recognized the immense potential of merging these two innovative worlds. Our vision is to create **NexusBridge**, a bridge seamlessly connecting web2 and web3, empowering developers to create invaluable applications that blend the best features of both realms.

#### Vision:
**NexusBridge** revolutionizes the digital service landscape by bridging web2 and web3, enabling a more open, collaborative internet. This empowers developers to create invaluable apps, blending the features of both worlds.

#### Description:

##### **NexusBridge: A Symbiotic Ecosystem**
**NexusBridge** aims to establish a symbiotic ecosystem where web2 applications and components coexist with web3's decentralized technologies, fostering a more inclusive development community. Some potential applications of **NexusBridge** include:

- Marrying Generative AI with NFTs for unique digital assets.
- Bringing the convenience of Telegram Bots to the De-Fi ecosystem.
- Integrating ChatGPT capabilities within the NFT space.
- Combining the efficiency of Poseidon Hash with Roll-up technologies.

##### **How NexusBridge Works**
Imagine a situation where each node runs identical deterministic JavaScript code, activated by a transaction. The outcomes are concurrently uploaded to the blockchain and verified by a smart contract. Within this context, the web2 logic, represented by JavaScript, is executed and validated in alignment with web3's decentralization principles.

###### Process:
1. **Register**: Begin by registering your web2 code. Ensure it's written in JavaScript.
2. **Request**: Initiate a call to execute your web2 code, specifying the desired function and providing input parameters.
3. **Response**: After executing the web2 code, each node derives a result. This result undergoes a consensus process among a subset of nodes to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Upon achieving consensus, the validated result is uploaded directly to the target chain, triggering a specific function call on the designated contract.

By following these steps, developers can ensure seamless integration of their web2 applications within the web3 environment provided by **NexusBridge**.

##### **System Architecture**
The system's architecture encompasses three primary components: smart contracts, bots, and virtual machines (v8).

- **Smart Contract**: The NexusBridge contract manages web2 activities, project registration, and the transmission of execution results.
- **Bot**: The NexusBridge bot monitors contracts for incoming requests. When a request appears, it prompts the NexusBridge backend (virtual machine) to run the code. It also retrieves execution outcomes and forwards them to the target contract.
- **Virtual Machine**: The NexusBridge backend fetches and executes user-provided JavaScript code. It presents an API endpoint for the NexusBridge bot, enabling code execution based on specific input parameters.

##### **Highlighted Features**
**NexusBridge** enables the execution and validation of deterministic JavaScript codes (or codes written in any language) triggered by on-chain transactions without compromising web3 decentralization principles. This ensures that web2 logic represented by JavaScript codes can be executed and validated in a decentralized manner.

Highlighted features include:

- **Multichain-aware**: **NexusBridge** stands out with its multichain capabilities. Actions initiated on one chain can find their responses on another. We've crafted **NexusBridge** versions compatible with both EVM-based blockchains and CosmWasm-based blockchains.
- **Adjustable Consensus**: **NexusBridge** ensures the integrity of web2 logic execution through redundant validation. The requester, whether a user or a contract, possesses the flexibility to dynamically alter the quorum of redundancy. This provides a balance between execution speed (latency) and security. Opting for execution on a singular node allows for the realization of indeterministic web2 logic and its outcomes. However, a smaller quorum may present centralization risks and security concerns. To counter these risks, a specialized node or group of nodes employing Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) like Intel SGX can be used.
- **Heterogeneous Execution Environment**: **NexusBridge** offers unparalleled versatility in node environments. As long as a node adheres to the stipulated request/response format, there are no constraints on the execution settings. This means nodes can be built on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and can have varying fee structures.
- **Enhanced Encryption**: By employing TEE nodes, users can transmit encrypted private data with confidence. While the original data remains concealed from prying eyes, the TEE can process this information, derive results, and subsequently upload the outcomes to the designated blockchain.

##### **Applications**
**NexusBridge**'s fusion of web2 and web3 unlocks pioneering possibilities:

- **Telegram Nexus Bot**: Project registration on **NexusBridge** is made smooth via the 'NexusBridge-mother' bot.
- **Verbose Swap Router**: This feature innovatively melds token swapping (web3) with telegram messaging (web2), offering a unique experience.
- **Intelligent NFT**: Intelligent NFTs (iNFTs) let blockchain enthusiasts converse with off-chain ChatGPT bots within the blockchain environment. **NexusBridge** serves as a linchpin, incorporating tools like ChatGPT and generative AIs into this decentralized framework.

##### **Integration with Archway**
**NexusBridge**, operating on the Archway platform, enables rewards for web2 activities based on transactions. With **NexusBridge**, ARCH emerges as a universal asset for web2, web3, and hybrid applications.

##### **Research Endeavors**
**NexusBridge** is more than just a tech product. It's a movement aiming to unite centralized and decentralized digital landscapes, thereby unlocking a realm of innovations. Notable research supporting **NexusBridge**'s vision includes:

- **BRAIN** exemplifies merging AI with blockchain. [Link to research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04062)
- **Zero-knowledge Address Abstraction (zkAA)** handles web2 identities on the blockchain. [Link to research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/191)

With **NexusBridge**, the future of digital services is now, bridging the gap between web2 and web3 for a more open, collaborative, and innovative internet.
