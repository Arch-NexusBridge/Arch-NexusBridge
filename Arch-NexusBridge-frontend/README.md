üß≠ NexusBridge | Enabling Rewards for All
üî≠ Overview
NexusBridge is an innovative solution built on the Archway platform that bridges the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, enabling the rewarding of web2 actions without compromising web3 decentralization principles. It broadens the scope of Archway's reward system and paves the way for the integration of diverse industries, including AI, gaming, and database sectors, into the decentralized Web 3.0 environment.

Picture a scenario where each node runs the same deterministic JavaScript code, triggered by a transaction, with the results uploaded simultaneously to the blockchain and validated by a smart contract. In this context, the web2 logic represented by JavaScript code is executed and validated without undermining the principles of web3 decentralization.

üß© Integration with Archway
NexusBridge, operating on the Archway platform, enables rewards for Web2 activities based on transactions. With NexusBridge, ARCH emerges as a universal asset for Web2, Web3, and hybrid applications.

Process Overview:
Execute: Off-chain components like AI, Game, and Database send execution requests to NexusBridge.
Trigger: NexusBridge triggers the execution on the Archway blockchain, ensuring decentralized verification.
Response: After the execution, NexusBridge collects the responses and sends them back to the off-chain components.
More Transactions: Successful executions lead to more transactions on the Archway network.
More Rewards: Increased transactions result in more rewards in the form of ARCH tokens.
More Developers and Apps: The rewards incentivize developers to create more applications, driving further integration and usage.
This cyclical process fosters a vibrant ecosystem where Web2 and Web3 technologies seamlessly interact, enhancing the overall capabilities and user experience.
